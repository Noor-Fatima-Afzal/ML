                --(Notes)--
y=mx+c
so find m and c
m=[np.sum((x - x_mean) * (y - y_mean))  /  np.sum((x - x_mean) ** 2)]

c=y_mean - (slope* x_mean)

TSS=total variance in the output data
TSS=sum((y - y_mean) ** 2)

RSS=the difference between the actual and predicted values
RSS=sum(self.residual_ ** 2)

variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s)
R-Squared = 1 - (RSS / TSS)
