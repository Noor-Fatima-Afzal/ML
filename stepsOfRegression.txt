Here are the main steps you typically follow when solving a regression problem:

1. Data Collection: 
Gather your data from various sources.

2. Data Preprocessing: 
Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers), perform feature engineering (create new features, transform 
existing ones), and scale the features if necessary.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Analyze the data to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable. This can 
involve visualizations, correlation matrices, etc.

4. Split the Data: 
Divide your data into a training set and a test set. This allows you to evaluate your model's performance on 
unseen data.

5. Model Selection: 
Choose a regression model. This could be simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial 
regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, etc. The choice of model depends on your data and the problem 
at hand.

6. Train the Model: 
Fit the model to your training data. This involves finding the parameters of the regression function that 
minimize the difference between the predicted and actual target values in the training data.

7. Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the test data. Common metrics for regression problems include 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

8. Model Optimization: 
Tune the model parameters to improve performance. This could involve techniques like grid search or 
cross-validation.

9. Prediction: 
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

10. Model Deployment (optional): 
If the model's performance is satisfactory, it can be deployed to a production environment where it can be used
 to make predictions on new, real-world data.

Remember, these steps are not always linear and may require iteration. For example, you might go back to the 
data preprocessing step after performing EDA, or you might go back to the model selection step after evaluating
 your model's performance.
